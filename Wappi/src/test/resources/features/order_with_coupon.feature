  Scenario Outline: Successfully Order With Coupon
    Given that I want to enter the page
      | userName | <userName> |
      | password | <password> |
    When I get the welcome coupon code
    And I place an "<offer>" order with the discount code
    Then I value that the order has been correctly executed "<expectedResult>"

    Examples:
      | userName      | password      | offer      | expectedResult              |
